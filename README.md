## 🌟 Overview & Architecture

**Seemanchal Express** is a modern, full-stack digital news portal and multi-tier organizational management system built specifically for the Seemanchal region (Kishanganj, Purnea, Araria, Katihar, Bihar) and national news coverage.

### Key Architectural Highlights
- **State Management:** **Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`)** with modular reducers:
  - `authSlice.js`: Access token in Redux memory, user identity, role, and approval status.
  - `newsSlice.js`: Live breaking news ticker, featured hero headlines, regional news streams, and categories.
  - `teamSlice.js`: Multi-tier committee structure and approved leaders.
  - `adminSlice.js`: Application reviews, metrics analytics, custom position manager, and live news desk.
  - `reporterSlice.js`: Submissions tracker and article drafts.
- **Authentication & Security:** **Dual JWT Token Architecture**:
  - **Short-Lived Access Token:** Kept strictly in Redux memory (no localStorage exposure to XSS).
  - **Long-Lived Refresh Token:** Stored in **`HttpOnly` cookies** (`SameSite: Lax`, secure in production).
  - **Axios Interceptor (`api.js`):** Injects `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` into every request and automatically handles silent token refreshes via `/api/auth/refresh-token` on 401s using request queueing.
- **Documents Engine:**
  - **Digital ID Card Generator:** Live QR code verification linked to public verify portal `/verify/[id]`.
  - **Official Appointment Letter:** Printable letterhead with official seal, reference number, and jurisdictional duties.
